/**
 * Fix for vw, vh, vmin, vmax on iOS 7.
 * http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units

 *
 * This fix works by replacing viewport units with px values on known screen sizes.
 *
 * iPhone 6 and 6 Plus cannot run iOS 7, so are not targeted by this fix.
 * Target devices running iOS 8+ will incidentally execute the media query,
 * but this will still produce the expected result; so this is not a problem.
 *
 * As an example, replace:
 *
 *   height: 50vh;
 *   font-size: 5vmin;
 *
 * with:
 *
 *   @include viewport-unit(height, 50vh);
 *   @include viewport-unit(font-size, 5vmin);
